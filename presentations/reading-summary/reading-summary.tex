    \frametitle{Shared/coordinated computation}

    Shared computation requires coordination between otherwise independent units
    of that computation in order to achieve \textit{consensus}. Traditionally,
    this might mean at least one of:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item A consensus algorithm, like Paxos or Raft.
      \item Reliable broadcast, where a load-balancer proxies requests to
        multiple nodes in a system.
      \item Leader-follower(s) architecture, with leader election.
      \item Atomic commit.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Replicated data-types}

    Since~\cite{shapiro11}, Conflict-Free Replicated Datatypes are yet another
    way to solve the coordinated computation problem. They fit when your problem
    is shaped like:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item (Optionally) weak network guarantees; there exist formulations that
        are appropriate for weak and strong networks, more on this later.
      \item Want to tolerate node failure.
      \item Cannot tolerate coordination lag (i.e., nodes should be able to
        operate independently of one another, no load balancers required).
      \item Can tolerate temporary divergence.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{CRDT overview}

    A \textit{Conflict-free replicated data type} (hereafter, CRDT) is a (1)
    datatype and (2) replication strategy for ensuring that multiple,
    independent, and uncoordinated actors can converge on a shared value.

    \vspace{1em}

    Two broad classes of specification:
    \begin{description}
      \item[State-based] Each message is an element in a \textit{monotone join
        semi-lattice} of the possible state-space; replicas define $\sqcup$ to
        take in new states.
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item We will later consider the case where the messages cover a
            subset of the sender's lattice, these are called $\delta$-CRDTs.
        \end{enumerate}
      \item[Op-based] Each message is either an idempotent \textit{query} or a
        mutative
    \end{description}
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{State-based CRDT}

    Given a state-space $\mathcal{S}$, a state-based CRDT $\mathcal{P}$ is
    defined~\parencite{shapiro11}:

    \[
      \mathcal{P} = (S, s^0, q, u, m)
    \]
    where:
    \begin{description}
      \item[$S$] the set of all possible states; i.e., that $s^{(t)} \in S$.
      \item[$s^{(0)}$] the initial state.
      \item[$q$] a non-modifying query method.
      \item[$u$] a modifying update method.
      \item[$m$] a \textit{commutative} $\sqcup$ merge operation.
    \end{description}

    \vspace{1em}

    Note that $S$ in fact must form a join semi-lattice; i.e., that if $s, s'
    \in \mathcal{S}$, that:
    \[
      s \sqsubseteq s \sqcup s',\quad s' \sqsubseteq s \sqcup s'
    \]
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{State-based CRDT}

    Several properties of the lattice $\mathcal{S}$ are exploited to produce an
    appealingly weak set of requirements:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item A commutative $\sqcup$ allows messages to be delivered out-of-order.
      \item An idempotent $\sqcup$ allows messages to be duplicated.
    \end{enumerate}

    With an appropriate choice of anti-entropy algorithm (e.g., one that gossips
    with other replicas infinitely often), then replicas are guaranteed to
    converge even when messages may be dropped~\citep{shapiro11}.
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{State-based CRDT example}

    We present the \textit{G-Counter} (read: ``grow-only counter''), which is a
    CRDT implemented as follows~\citep{almeida16}:
    \[
      \mathcal{P} = \left\{\begin{aligned}
        S &= \mathcal{I} \times \mathbb{N} \\
        s^{(0)} &= \left\{ \right\} \\
        q &= \sum_{j \in \mathcal{I}} m(j) \\
        u &= m\left\{ i \mapsto m(i) + 1 \right\} \\
        s \sqcup s' &= \left\{ j \mapsto \max(s(j), s'(j)) : j \in \text{dom}(s)
        \cup \text{dom}(s') \right\} \\
      \end{aligned}\right.
    \]
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{State-based CRDT example}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item In English, the state-based G-Counter maintains a mapping from host
        identifier to counter value, and answers queries regarding the value of
        the counter as the sum of all of the partial counters.
      \item The state payload can naturally ``drop'' messages, since a sup.
        element in the lattice can easily take its place.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item But, CRDT \textit{composition} can make individual states large
            and complex, leading to as-large payloads, which can be expensive to
            serialize/send/apply/etc.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{op-based CRDT}

    Given a state-space $\mathcal{S}$, an op-based CRDT $\mathcal{P}$ is
    defined~\parencite{shapiro11}:

    \[
      \mathcal{P} = (S, s^0, q, t, u)
    \]
    where $S$, $s^0$, and $q$ are the same as in the state-based CRDT, and:
    \begin{description}
      \item[$t$] a non-modifying \textit{prepare-update} method.
      \item[$u$] a modifying \textit{effect-update} method.
    \end{description}

    \[
      \begin{aligned}
        t &: \mathcal{S} \to (\mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S}) \\
        u &: (\mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S}) \to \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S} \\
      \end{aligned}
    \]

    on some operation $\sigma$, $t$ is run immediately at the replica executing
    $\sigma$, and the resulting effector is applied with $u$ immediately
    thereafter.

    That same effector is then applied at all other replicas by $u$.
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{op-based CRDT}

    The op-based CRDT has stronger requirements that must be met in order to
    guarantee consistency~\citep{shapiro11} These are a result of a lack of a
    merge method, and thus operations need not (and often don't) form a
    semi-lattice.

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Operations must be delivered in order.
      \item Operations must not be dropped, lest the entire system be halted.
      \item Operations must be delivered exactly once (or tagged and applied
        exactly once).
    \end{enumerate}

    CRDTs run over a TCP/IP implementation can thusly satisfy the above
    requirements.
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{op-based CRDT example}

    We now give a novel example of the op-based G-Counter. The definition is not
    quite as natural as the state-based one above, but is an example of the
    simulate-ability of the two.

    \[
      \mathcal{P} = \left\{\begin{aligned}
        S &= \mathcal{I} \times \mathbb{N} \\
        s^{(0)} &= \left\{ \right\} \\
        q &= \sum_{j \in \mathcal{I}} m(j) \\
        t &= \lambda p.\; p.m\left\{i \mapsto p.m(i) + 1 \right\} \\
        u(f) &= f(m)
      \end{aligned}\right.
    \]

    $t$ is a higher-order function that takes a CRDT instance $p$ and increments
    the partial-counter associated with its own ID. $u$ simply applies that
    function locally.
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{$\delta$-CRDT \& semi-lattice interaction}

    In the state-based CRDT example, we note that CRDT programs are sending far
    more data than is involved in their operation:
    \[
      u = m\left\{ i \mapsto m(i) + 1 \right\}
    \]
    where it would \textit{also} be sufficient to simply send:
    \[
      u = \left\{ i \mapsto m(i) + 1 \right\}
    \]
    where other entries are assumed to have values of $-\infty$. This idea is
    due to \cite{almeida16}. Then,
    \[
      \begin{aligned}
        u_i(X) &= X \sqcup u_i^\delta(X) \\
        m\left\{ i \mapsto m(i) + 1 \right\} &= m \sqcup \left\{ i \mapsto m(i) + 1 \right\}
      \end{aligned}
    \]
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{$\delta$-CRDT \& semi-lattice interaction}

    The idea of applying \textit{$\delta$-mutators} originates
    in~\cite{almeida16}, and is motivated by:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $\delta$ states \textit{are} just states; they are merely not quite
        the states you would expect to have.
      \item Several $\delta$ states can be grouped into a
        \textit{$\Delta$-group} and applied efficiently and with fewer overall
        messages.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{$\delta$-CRDT \& semi-lattice interaction}

    Because $\delta$ updates are just states, CRDT programs follow the
    state-based approach and define a commutative and idempotent $\sqcup$ merge
    operation over that lattice and retain \textbf{all of the benefits} of
    the state-based approach \textbf{without the payload size burden}.
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Consistency types}

    \begin{description}
      \item[Eventual consistency] An update delivered to one (correct) replica
        is eventually delivered to all replicas~\citep{shapiro11}.
      \item[Strong eventual consistency] (correct) replicas delivered the same
        sequence of updates (eventually) show the same state~\citep{shapiro11}.
      \item[Causal consistency] The causal happens-before relation on operations
        is retained (i.e., maintenance of the visibility
        relation)~\citep{almeida16}.
