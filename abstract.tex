\chapter{Abstract}

Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) are a natural structure with which
to communicate information about a shared computation in a distributed setting
where coordination overhead may not be tolerated, and individual participants
are allowed to temporarily diverge from the overall computation.  Within this
setting, there are two classical approaches: state- and operation-based CRDTs.
The former define a commutative, associative, and idempotent \textit{join}
operation, and their states a \textit{monotone join semi-lattice}. The latter
communicate \textit{operations}, the join of which is non-idempotent. Whereas
op-based CRDTs require little information to be exchanged, they demand
relatively strong network guarantees (exactly-once, in-order delivery), and
state-based CRDTs suffer the opposite problem. Both satisfy \textit{strong,
eventual consistency} (SEC)

We posit that $\delta$-CRDTs both (1) require minimal communication overhead
from payload size, and (2) tolerate relatively weak network environments, making
them an ideal candidate for real-world use of CRDTs. We present here a
mechanized proof that $\delta$-CRDTs do achieve SEC, even under relatively weak
network guarantees.
